Smart Energy Advisor: AI-Supported Efficiency for Every Home
Problem Statement: In the field of energy advice, conventional methods of assessing energy efficiency are time-consuming, require specialists, and are often inaccessible to many homeowners. Legal requirements are unclear, renovation costs are non-transparent, and information on subsidies is hard to find. This results in frustration, inefficiency, missed savings, and low user engagement.
HACKATHON CHALLENGE: How might we use LLMs and domain-specific knowledge to build a tailored energy advisor that delivers personalized energy consulting (e.g. including costs, funding) based on user-provided building information â€“ so that we can help users identify and implement energy-saving measures?
Available Data & Resources: Participants will have access to a curated set of websites for web scraping including energy-related content, legal texts as well as concrete example use cases to test and validate their solutions during the challenge.
Success Criteria: A successful solution interprets user inputs correctly (e.g., house or building characteristics) and generates relevant building refurbishment measures, actionable energy-saving recommendations including costs for actions. It should offer a graphical intuitive and intelligent interface to collect, store and retrieve input data.
Key Considerations: Solutions should ensure user-friendliness, respect data privacy, work in real-time, and ideally be scalable for different building types and use cases.
